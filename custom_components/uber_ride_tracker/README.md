# Uber Ride Tracker for Home Assistant

A comprehensive Home Assistant integration that provides real-time Uber ride tracking with OAuth authentication, similar to Apple's Live Activities feature.

## Features

### Real-Time Ride Tracking

- **Location Tracking**: Real-time GPS tracking of driver location on map
- **Trip Progress**: Visual progress indicator showing trip completion percentage
- **ETA Updates**: Pickup and destination ETA with real-time updates
- **Fare Estimates**: Current fare estimate for your ride

### Smart Update Intervals
- **Active Ride**: Updates every 10 seconds when ride is active
- **No Active Ride**: Updates every 60 seconds when idle
- **Error Recovery**: Extends to 5 minutes on repeated errors

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- **Token Expired**: The integration will automatically refresh tokens
- **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check your Client ID and Secret
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure all required scopes are enabled in your Uber app

### No Data Showing
- Check that you have an active or recent Uber ride
- Use the `uber_ride_tracker.refresh_status` service to force an update
- Check Home Assistant logs for any error messages

### Rate Limiting
- The integration respects Uber's rate limits (2000 calls/hour)
- If rate limited, the integration will automatically back off
- Update intervals adjust based on ride status to minimize API calls

### Common Issues

1. **"No active ride" status**
   - This is normal when you don't have an active Uber ride
   - The integration will automatically detect when a new ride starts

2. **Location not updating**
   - Driver location only updates during active rides
   - Ensure location permissions are granted in the Uber app

3. **Missing attributes**
   - Some attributes are only available during certain ride states
   - Driver information is only available after ride is accepted

## API Limitations

- **Rate Limits**: 2000 API calls per hour
- **Data Availability**: Some data only available during active rides
- **Historical Data**: Limited to recent trip history
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based (not WebSocket)

## Security Considerations

- OAuth tokens are stored securely in Home Assistant's credential storage
- Never share your Client ID or Client Secret
- Use HTTPS for your Home Assistant instance
- Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration
- No sensitive data is logged

## Support

### Getting Help
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/ha-uber-ride-tracker/issues) page
- Enable debug logging for detailed information:
